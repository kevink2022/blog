Great introduction to many different programming concepts. Highly recommend watching the whole channel, only 90 minutes on YouTube so far. Some of my favorites:
### [Why You Shouldn't Nest Your Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFRhGnuXG-4)
Highlights how simply limiting the amount you nest your code will force you to write better code. 
### [Don't Write Comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA)
In a similar way to nesting, shows how most comments can be eliminated by writing code that [reads like a language](/blog/blog/spoken_vs_programming_languages).
### [Dependency Injection, The Best Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeAesthetic/videos)
Great visualization and introduction to the many strengths and benefits of dependency injection.
