### [Are We There Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScEPu1cs4l0)
Rich Hickey goes into some of the flaws with how data is represented in object oriented programming and by clarifying the differences between value, time, identity, and state. Then he introduces a new mental model, inspired by mathematician and philosopher [Alfred North Whitehead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead), that does.
