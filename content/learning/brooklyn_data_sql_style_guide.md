### [Brooklyn Data Co. SQL style guide](https://github.com/brooklyn-data/co/blob/main/sql_style_guide.md)
A style guide? Well, if you work on SQL, I highly recommend checking it out. But even if you don't, a lot can be learned from the *intention* of each guideline. I really appreciate how every decision made in this guide had a specific intention, with a huge focus on making as many of the developers decisions *explicit* to future readers. 

If anything, I at least would like you to appreciate this quote that kicks off the style guide, and that I am sure my colleagues have heard enough of:

> "Newlines are cheap; people's time is expensive."
