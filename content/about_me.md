# About Me
I'm a Software Engineer from the Philadelphia area who went to Penn State. I fell in love with programming in middle school when my awesome math teacher showed the class our calculators could write programs. Before long, I would write the program that would do that night's homework before class ended (thank you again, Mrs. Zapor).

Outside of that, growing up I was very into sports (go birds), which culminated with me playing Volleyball in high school (go crusaders). While in high school, I fell in love with art (largely thanks to [Victory Fire](https://www.deviantart.com/sulfurbunny/gallery/36148502/victory-fire-book-one)) and music, which led me to learning how to draw and picking the piano up again. Though, shortly after drawing whats probably my [best piece](/blog/images/ben_simmons.JPG), I learned I have [aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia), and have focused my creative energy more into creative writing and programming as of late.

In college, I knew I wanted to study abroad, and found an engineering program at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, where I'd do undergraduate research on AI. That gave me enough of a reason to learn Japanese to an intermediate level. Unfortunately, the program was called off due to covid shortly before I was set to leave. But hey, at least I can watch anime while cooking. 

Later, sparked by finally watching Game of Thrones and then [Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/@HistoriaCivilis) on YouTube, I have become a bit of a history buff, mostly through podcasts. Highly recommend Dan Carlin's [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/), [The Rest is History](https://therestishistory.supportingcast.fm/) with Tom Holland (not the Spiderman one) and Dominic Sandbrook, and Mike Duncan's [The History of Rome](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/) and [Revolutions](https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/) to any podcast listeners out there.

I'm now living in Sacramento for my first full time job out of college. I recently picked up guitar to go along with piano, have been getting more into cooking to eat healthier, and on have gotten more into writing as a medium of thought through this blog.
