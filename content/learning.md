### Rich Hickey's Keynotes
My favorite engineer, Rich Hickey presents new ways to think about data and the craft of programming. I consider the 4 listed ones to be must watches. If you're working in software and haven't seen them, you're doing yourself a disservice.

Make sure you don't mistake easy for simple. Sounds weird? Watch and find out.

- [Are We There Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScEPu1cs4l0) - A break down state into its fundamental components, giving us a new way to think about data and observation in our digital systems, grounded in the real world.
- [Design, Composition, and Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCwqnjxqfmY) - Another angle to look at our systems through the analogy of the components that go into musical composition and performance.
- [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) - A dive into the psychology behind Rich Hickey's problem solving problem process, inspired partly by George Pólya's *How to Solve It*

A deep dive into the science of refactoring, and how to do it like a professional. A great perspective on the many ways we can design systems to be understandable and maintainable. And its where Martin gave the world this gem:
