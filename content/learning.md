# My Philosophy on Learning
I used to be under the impression the best way to learn was to consume the latest and most up to date book, lecture, or blog on some topic. With that, and some practice, anything could be learned. 

While that might work in some circumstances, it is definitely not how to build a truly deep understanding of a complex topic. The communication mediums of today are simply to not of a high enough bandwidth or resolution to communicate the complex multi-dimensional mental models an expert has on a topic, no matter how good they are at transmitting that message.

Like the neural networks based on our neural anatomy, the only way to build a complex multi-dimensional mental model of a topic is to consume as many different perspectives and experiences as possible, and compare them against your current model. Through this iterative process, we can start to build our own perspective, totally unique to us, but that makes us as effective as the professionals, mentors, and lecturers we hope to emulate.

And with that, here are some of the learning materials that contributed most to my current mental model of what makes great software and organizations.

### Rich Hickey's Keynotes
My favorite engineer, Rich Hickey presents new ways to think about data and the craft of programming. I consider the 4 listed ones to be must watches. If you're working in software and haven't seen them, you're doing yourself a disservice.

Make sure you don't mistake easy for simple. Sounds weird? Watch and find out.

Other favorites:
- [Are We There Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScEPu1cs4l0) - A break down state into its fundamental components, giving us a new way to think about data and observation in our digital systems, grounded in the real world.
- [Design, Composition, and Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCwqnjxqfmY) - Another angle to look at our systems through the analogy of the components that go into musical composition and performance.
- [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) - A dive into the psychology behind Rich Hickey's problem solving problem process, inspired partly by George Pólya's *How to Solve It*

### Code Complete 2
*By Scott McConnell*

[![Original Database with coupled file interface](/blog/images/code_complete_2.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete)

A complete handbook on code construction. If you could only read one book to create readable, maintainable software, this would have to be it. A must read for anyone serious about software. 

### The Design of Everyday Things
*By Don Norman*

[![Original Database with coupled file interface](/blog/images/design_of_everyday_things.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things)

A fascinating deep dive into how people actually use and interact with things, packed with great metaphors and design heuristics, teaching you to design *for* people and their strengths, instead of wishing they were machines. This book has changed the way I think about almost everything I interact with, from the physical products often used as examples, to the organizations I interact with and even the way I approach my life.

### The Psychology of Computer Programming
*By Gerald Weinberg*

[![The Psychology of Computer Programming Cover](/blog/images/pocp.png)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1660754.The_Psychology_of_Computer_Programming)

The first book of its kind, Gerald Weinberg goes through all the human aspects to writing code. From how our languages and tools, our organizations, leaders, and colleagues, our goals and environments, our past experiences and current circumstances, and more all effect the work we do. Though it was written in 1971, people don't change like technology does, and I have learned so much from this book, from how informal networks effect our 

### Idealcast
*By Gene Kim*

[![Original Database with coupled file interface](/blog/images/idealcast.png)](https://itrevolution.com/podcast/)

Gene Kim brings technology and business leaders to bring together their perspectives so we can all learn how to build effective teams and organizations to build effective products. Some of my favorite guests include Steven Spear, Elisabeth Hendrickson, and Ron Westrum.

### Refactoring
*By Martin Fowler*

[![Original Database with coupled file interface](/blog/images/refactoring.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring)

A deep dive into the science of refactoring, and how to do it like a professional. A great perspective on the many ways we can design systems to be understandable and maintainable. And its where Martin gave the world this gem:

> “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”

### CodeAesthetic

{{< youtube CFRhGnuXG-4 >}}

A catalog of high quality, accessible videos that dive into software design concepts, encouraging clean and maintainable code. The first thing I send to anyone looking to take their software quality to the next level.
