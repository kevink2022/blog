## Projects
#### [Boomic Music](https://github.com/kevink2022/Boomic)
*Swift, SwiftUI, Functional Programming, Persistent Data Structures, Combine, async/await*
January 2024 -- Present
- iOS music playback app for high resolution audio codecs (e.g. FLAC) and music library manager.
- Automatically populates the music library through the iOS Files app, allowing for drag and drop. Organizes music into albums and artists based on metadata and displays associated album art.
- Built with **persistent data structures** and **functional programming principles** while still taking advantage of SwiftUI's powerful observation libraries using **Combine queues** for efficient, decoupled and reactive communication.
- Utilizes a transaction based persistence system, allowing for users to roll back erroneous changes.
- Thorough **unit testing**, often following **test driven design**, writing tests before the code.
- Architecture and design decisions discussed in detail on my blog at [kevink2022.github.io/blog/tags/boomic/](/blog/tags/boomic/)
#### [Channels](https://github.com/kevink2022/channels)
*C, GDB, Valgrind, pthread, semaphores*
January 2022 -- May 2022
- Multi-thread safe buffered channel system enabling threads to send or receive data. 
- Incorporates a 'select' function enabling threads to submit multiple send/receive operations, ensuring that only one operation is completed.
- Implemented in **C**. Employed linked lists for queue management, **mutex locks** for thread safety, and **semaphores** to control access to resources. 
- Utilized **GDB** and **Valgrind** for debugging and memory safety.
