      <description>Simple Made Easy An absolute classic, which I have watched at least once a month since I first saw it. I think anyone writing software without understanding the fundamental difference between simple and easy that Rich articulates in this talk is destined to make some serious mistakes. This general concept of simple vs easy has to be the biggest influence on how I think not just about software, but pretty much everything, and it was the key that finally unblocked me from writing large systems without inevitable &amp;lsquo;inviting the elephant&amp;rsquo; as Rich describes in 2012 follow-up Simplicity Matters.</description>
