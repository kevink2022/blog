The app quickly became a coupled disaster, and making the smallest changes felt daunting. This time around, I committed to learning and understanding software design and architecture. To learn to build a composable system, designed for change. This is how I started, where I went wrong, and where I am now.</p>
<p>I ended up starting my development based on the layered architecture from Jacob Bartlett&rsquo;s excellent post on <a href="https://jacobbartlett.substack.com/p/modular-architecture-for-apps">Modular Architecture for Apps</a>. I was closely following the architecture of their <a href="https://github.com/jacobsapps/bev17/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file">Bev Sample App</a>, using the Repository pattern, featured in his series on <a href="https://jacobbartlett.substack.com/p/async-unit-testing-in-swift-the-comprehensive">Async Unit Testing</a>. I highly recommend <a href="https://jacobbartlett.substack.com/">Jacobs Tech Tavern</a> to any iOS app developers.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Repository Pattern&rsquo; is where you create a single <code>Repository</code> component that serves the data to the UI. The UI doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about where the data is coming from, while the repository can combine data from different sources. In Bev, Jacob shows a use case of grabbing local, cached data from a database, while fetching the most up-to-date data from an API. Here&rsquo;s cut down version of what this looks like in Bev:</p>

I needed some kind of <code>MediaFileInterface</code> to load audio files from a root directory and extract their metadata into the <code>Song</code> objects. Thinking that the database was likely the only thing that needed to load files this way, as the rest of my app could just use the songs from the database, I went with a design like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/original_database.svg" alt="Original Database with coupled file interface"></p>
<p>It was after watching Rich Hickey&rsquo;s <a href="/blog/learning/design_composition_performance.md">Design, Composition, and Performance</a> that I realized what kind of mistake I was making with the database.</p>
<p>I thought that simply by using Swift&rsquo;s protocols, I was keeping these components decoupled. I could easily switch from a local to a remote directory with the same <code>MediaFileInterface</code> protocol. But I was still coupling the <code>Database</code> to the fact that it had to know where it was getting its <code>Song</code> objects from. This had flown under my radar until I thought about Apple Music. A long-term goal of Boomic is to be able to sync your Apple Music library alongside your local library. Since I want to have the same tags and ratings for both Apple Music and local songs, I wanted to store them in the same database. Assuming I did that that now, the architecture would look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/original_database_expanded.svg" alt="Original Database with two coupled file interfaces"></p>
<p>I would need to edit the <code>Database</code> itself, its public interface, and the repository that calls it. By just making the database aware of a protocol to get new songs, I was giving the database an extra responsibility: don&rsquo;t just store the songs, but get the new ones as well. Lets remove that separate responsibility and see what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/decoupled_database.svg" alt="Update, decoupled database with separate file interface"></p>
<p>Now, the <code>Repository</code> can simply have two different functions for each different source. The <code>Database</code> itself can be designed in a much simpler, more generic manner, without worrying where it is getting new data from. More importantly, when I want to add the Apple Music support, I now only have to change the app-specific <code>Repository</code>. I simply a create a new composition of a new component, the <code>AppleMusicInterface</code>, and an old one, the <code>Database</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="breaking-it-down-composers-and-instruments">Breaking it down: Composers and Instruments</h3>
<p>I really liked the general repository pattern, and felt it could be extended outside the realm of data operations. As I mentioned earlier, it was watching <a href="/blog/learning/design_composition_performance.md">Design, Composition, and Performance</a> when the value of the repository pattern really clicked for me. So, lets borrow some vocabulary (albeit with a slightly different use) and see how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instruments:</strong> Single responsibility, usually generic components.</li>
<li><strong>Composers</strong>: Components that coordinate one or more instruments to achieve something specific.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my app so far, the <code>Database</code>, <code>MediaFileInterface</code>, <code>AppleMusicInterface</code>, and any other sources of data such as an <code>ImageCache</code> are the instruments. Each instrument does their specific tasks, is completely decoupled from other instruments, and can be reused in other parts of the program. Then, the <code>Repository</code> is a composer that handles the specific needs of my app by, well, composing these instruments together.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="composers-as-instruments">Composers as Instruments.</h3>
<p>I want to make one thing about this design philosophy clear: Just because something is an instrument, doesn&rsquo;t mean it cannot be composed of other instruments. An example of this is how I am currently storing transactions.</p>
<p>To store transactions as they&rsquo;re received, I built a generic <code>LogStore</code> class that saves <code>Codable</code> objects at a key in the order they&rsquo;re received, like a standard log. This is pretty clearly an instrument: single-responsibility, generic, ready to be composed into various purpose specific components. But the <code>LogStore</code> itself was composed with another instrument: the <code>SimpleStore</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>SimpleStore</code> itself just saves and overwrites the object saved at its key. So the most basic implementation of a <code>LogStore&lt;T&gt;</code> can just use a single <code>SimpleStore&lt;[T]&gt;</code>, which is exactly what I have done for now as my proof-of-concept:</p>

A better version of this would be using multiple simple stores, with a cache <code>SimpleStore</code> for quickly saving of the most recent logs, which are periodically merged them in with the older logs from another <code>SimpleStore</code> in the background. Either way, the <code>LogStore</code> here an example of a composer: composing one or more instances of the generic <code>SimpleStore</code> instrument. But, it itself is a generic, composable instrument, that I use to store transactions now, and probably logs in the future.</p>
<p>I think Rich Hickey really illustrates this point well at from <a href="https://youtu.be/QCwqnjxqfmY?t=2479&amp;si=jhGajdysPBKZE5As">41:19-42:42</a> in, you guessed it, Design, Composition, and Performance! <a href="https://www.arturia.com/stories/yvesusson-insideamodularmind">Yves Usson</a>, who designed the synthesizer, composed the synthesizer it out of machines that themselves are individual instruments, or at least would be in this current mental model. Then, the synthesizer itself is an instrument available to musicians to be composed with other instruments.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="isnt-this-obvious">Isn&rsquo;t this obvious?</h3>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just another way of saying &lsquo;we should be building composable systems?&rsquo; Yeah, pretty much, but I think there is a lot of value in reframing the way we think about our systems with specific terminology and strong analogies. In just writing this post and applying this thinking to the system that inspired it, I realized that the <code>MediaFileInterface</code>, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily violate the Single Responsibility Principle (translate all the files in a root directory into <code>Song</code> objects), is both not generalizable, and could be broken apart into two separate, more generalizable, instruments.</p>

I was comfortable calling the <code>MediaFileInterface</code> a simple, single responsibility component that only had one public function. And it was only 60 lines. But it was a specific component I built for a specific purpose. When I want to play guitar in a new key, do I buy a whole new guitar? No, I take my existing guitar, and just put on, <em>or compose it with,</em> a capo!</p>
<p>So, after reframing the question, I was not comfortable calling the <code>MediaFileInterface</code> a good instrument. Which led me to asking &ldquo;Could this be composed of simpler instruments?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Could this be more generic?&rdquo; and ended with me building the new, more generic <code>FileInterface</code>, which I am already using in another part of the <code>Repository</code>.</p>
<p>To summarize, I think we can build the vast majority of what we create with generic instruments and a few composers. Whenever we do something specific, we should try to break it down into generic instruments, and build those instruments up with simpler and simpler instruments. This will give us many a huge toolbox of generic, testable instruments, which can easily be rearranged to make changes.</p>

<h3 id="in-practice">In Practice</h3>
<p>Finally back to the app, what does Boomic look like today. I am still some time away from the MVP, and so plan on updating this part of the post down the road. Especially if (more likely when) I find I didn&rsquo;t have as complete of an understanding as I thought I had. But here is the current structure. Relatively flat, but much, much less coupled then its predecessor:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/boomic_arc.svg" alt="boomic_architecture"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Repository</code></strong>: Composer of the data instruments, specifically for the UI.
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Transactor</code></strong>: Serially stores library transactions, and publishes a new <code>DataBasis</code> to reflect that transaction.
<ul>
<li><strong><code>DataBasis</code></strong>: Immutable value of the entire library.  Progression of state tracked by the <code>Transactor</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>QueryEngine</code></strong>: Queries a <code>DataBasis</code> value.</li>
<li><strong><code>FileInterface</code></strong>: Provides enumerations of specified file extensions from a root directory.</li>
<li><strong><code>MetadataLoader</code></strong>: Extracts metadata from audio files, both embedded and from the surrounding files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Player</code></strong>: Composer of the audio playback instruments. Has a fair amount of state.
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Engine</code></strong>: The interface to the library that makes the system calls to playback audio. Each song gets its own engine, allowing for pre-loading. Has a fair amount of state.</li>
<li><strong><code>Queue</code></strong>: An immutable value representing the queue. Progression of state tracked by the <code>Player</code>.</li>
<li><strong><code>Mixer</code></strong>: Applies EQ and Effects to the <code>Engine</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>ImageCache</code></strong>: Shared cache, keys embedded album art with MD5 hashes to prevent initializing the same images over and over.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="immediate-plans">Immediate Plans</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code>LiveQueryEngine</code> that tracks changes and updates views when the <code>DataBasis</code> updates.</li>
<li>Have the <code>Player</code> directly access the <code>Repository</code> instead of just sharing the <code>ImageCache</code> so it can respond to <code>DataBasis</code> updates.</li>
<li>Look into making the <code>Engine</code>, <code>Queue</code>, and <code>Transactor</code>, classes more generic. They all currently rely on this app&rsquo;s custom data types, but don&rsquo;t necessarily need to.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more work to do to make the immutable <code>DataBasis</code> pattern work with Swifts observation frameworks, and make the UI reactive to specific changes. I have reflected on whether keeping the pattern is worth it and have decided to continue it. More on that in a future post.</p>

<p>Most professional programmers and software engineers have used, or at least dabbled with, many different languages throughout their careers. To the point where switching to another language becomes almost trivial. We can design systems with these fundamental constructs, then implement them in pretty much any language.</p>
<p>Once we obtain that deep understanding of fundamental constructs, we can become very confident and proud of our ability to &rsquo;think in computer.&rsquo; Which is essential, we are writing for computers after all. But we often fail to see the drawbacks in limiting our thinking like that. I knew that we should strive for clean, &lsquo;readable&rsquo; code, but I didn&rsquo;t truly understand the essence of that goal until I tried to think in another spoken language.</p>

<h3 id="to-understand-or-to-be-understood">To understand or to be understood.</h3>
<p>The Japanese word that inspired this line of thinking was 分かる (pronounced <em>wakaru</em>), which is a verb that <em>translates</em> to &rsquo;to understand.&rsquo; I had learned it a few years back in college in preparation to study abroad, but covid had other plans for my time in college. Now as a graduate, I decided to start learning Japanese again because it was quite fun, and I&rsquo;m no longer in a rush to learn it all within two years.</p>
<p>One of the many details I often brushed pass the first time around was whether verbs were <em>intransitive</em> or <em>transitive</em>. That&rsquo;s whether or not the verb is performed by the subject on itself (intransitive) or on a direct object (transitive). Basically, in the sentence &lsquo;<em>I</em> am running,&rsquo; running is intransitive, because I, the subject, is what is running. On the other hand, in the sentence &lsquo;I am running the <em>dishwasher,</em>&rsquo; running is transitive, because I, the subject, am performing the verb on the dishwasher, the direct object.</p>
<p>To my horror, I realized 分かる was intransitive. In my many conversations (mostly with myself, I have been terrified to make this exact kind of mistake online) I have had in Japanese these last few years, I have been using 分かる wrong, as a transitive verb.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B">Wanikani explanation</a> of the word says it best, so I&rsquo;ll just quote it here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This word means to <em>understand</em>, which might surprise you if you remember that the kanji 分 means <em>part</em>. Think of it this way: to understand something you have to break it down into its parts to see how it works.</p>
<p>Watch out, though, because whereas in English you understand something, in Japanese the thing you understand is the grammatical subject (it&rsquo;s doing the action). So, a more literal meaning for this is <em>to be understandable</em>. In other words, there&rsquo;s no object, and 分かる is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The かる ending is a hint, because verbs with かる as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this is a completely different <em>mental model</em>, almost a different way of thinking. Lets borrow that word <em>model</em> and take a look at at what I mean. If I wanted to say &lsquo;I understand that book&rsquo; in Japanese, I would say「その本が分かる.」Lets break that down real quick:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&lsquo;Word&rsquo;</th>
<th>Pronounciation</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>その</td>
<td>sono</td>
<td>that (object)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>本</td>
<td>hon</td>
<td>book</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>が</td>
<td>ga</td>
<td>subject marker, marking その本 as the subject</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>分かる</td>
<td>wakaru</td>
<td>to be understandable</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So then, lets take a look at how the models differ in each language:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th><em>Model</em></th>
<th>In a sentance</th>
<th>Translation of the <em>model</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To understand</td>
<td>To understand</td>
<td>I understand that book</td>
<td>その本を分かる (grammatically incorrect)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>分かる</td>
<td><em>To be understandable</em></td>
<td>その本が分かる</td>
<td>That book is understandable.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The only difference between the correct sentence and the one I would&rsquo;ve said is that I would have replaced が, the &lsquo;subject marker,&rsquo; with を, the &lsquo;direct object marker.&rsquo; Instead of the book, I as the speaker would implicitly be the subject of that sentence. Which, of course, is a grammatically incorrect use of the Japanese verb, but makes perfect sense to me if I am using my English model.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I do my Wanikani flashcards, I always try and take care to answer with the meaning that&rsquo;s the closest <em>model</em> to the word, which is not necessarily the closest <em>translation.</em></p>
<p>This fundamental difference in the modeling everyday situations is reflected even stronger in the closest translations of the words &rsquo;to like&rsquo; and &rsquo;to want,&rsquo; which are 好き (pronounced <em>suki</em>) and 欲しい (pronounced <em>hoshii</em>) respectively. You might be thinking, &ldquo;Are they just like 分かる in the previous example, where they&rsquo;re just intransitive verbs?&rdquo; Nope, they&rsquo;re <em><strong>adjectives</strong></em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th><em>Model</em></th>
<th>In a sentance</th>
<th>Translation of the <em>model</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To like</td>
<td>To like</td>
<td>I like that book</td>
<td>その本を好きだ (<em>very</em> grammatically incorrect)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>好き</td>
<td>is likeable</td>
<td>その本が好きだ</td>
<td>That book is likeable.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I absolutely could not wrap my head around this general model when I first learned it. When we use adjectives in English, we are generally either saying an objective fact, or we preface our subjective opinions with the fact that they are, well, opinions. I mean, if you were struggling to grasp some LeetCode problem and asked me for help, and I walked over and said &lsquo;That problem is understandable.&rsquo; You might think I&rsquo;m insulting you!</p>
<p>But Japanese is a <em>heavily</em> context based language. So when I say a thing is understandable, it is generally understood to be my point of view of the situation, not a comment on whether the thing is easy to understand.</p>

<h3 id="but-what-does-this-have-to-do-with-programming-languages">But what does this have to do with programming languages?</h3>
<p>I think the weight of the word language in programming <em>language</em> is often lost on us. Just like how I have to rewire my brain to think in a Japanese model, I had to do the same when I was first learning to program, just in a model of computation. Thinking in variables, if/else blocks, loops, etc. But unlike when I use my English model in a Japanese sentence, using an unclear or incorrect model to solve a problem might not just result in harmless little grammar mistakes, but it could have real world consequences. Even if you&rsquo;re confident in you and your team&rsquo;s ability to &rsquo;think in computer,&rsquo; you should have no faith in their ability to &lsquo;<em>communicate</em> in computer.&rsquo; Similar to Japanese, programming languages themselves can be dangerously context dependent, and far too much can get lost in translation.</p>
<p>Think back to the explanation of those Japanese sentences. Presuming you&rsquo;re a native English speaker, to understand the meaning of the Japanese sentences, you needed to know both:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the sentence was built via the <em>Japanese model.</em></li>
<li>The message being communicated via the <em>English translation.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I think the same thing is going on whenever we write programs. We build our code &lsquo;sentences&rsquo; in a <em>computer model</em> to be executed. But the computer isn&rsquo;t the only one who needs to understand our code: people need to as well.</p>
<p>So, we need to focus on being explicit in the intention of our code by including translation, the actual meaning we&rsquo;re trying to communicate, <em>within</em> the code.</p>
<p>Remember the mistranslation that can occur from earlier if we tried to communicate with a different model:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;That problem is understandable.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>(Is he insulting me?)</em> &ldquo;I think its pretty difficult.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These same mistranslations, inaccurate assumptions about another&rsquo;s intention, will occur when we try and communicate in computer models. A dead simple example (imagining no documentation):</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">1</span><span>sleep(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>) <span style="color:#75715e">// minutes, seconds, microseconds? you might not have the context, but the computer knows.</span>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span style="white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f">4</span><span>sleep(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span><span style="color:#f92672">*</span>SECONDS) <span style="color:#75715e">// this is the exact same model with an included translation</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>A little anecdote I like to remember this concept by, when I went to sports camps as a kid, something we were always told was to &ldquo;stay on the balls of your feet.&rdquo; I mistranslated their message of &ldquo;keep your weight forward&rdquo; as &ldquo;keep those heels <em>off</em> the ground buddy.&rdquo; I have <em>massive</em> calves now. What may seem obvious to you might fly right over someone else&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>But whats far more likely then a simple mistranslation, and what I&rsquo;d wager you&rsquo;ve encountered many more times, is when there is <em>nothing</em> to translate. When your reading some code and you sit there, thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What on <em>earth</em> were they trying to do here? What could their intention possibly have been?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, all bets are off, who knows if you&rsquo;re going to translate that code correctly.</p>
<p>I could take the time to come up with some more examples, but I think I would have a hard time not accidentally plagiarizing these two excellent <a href="/blog/learning/code_aesthetic">CodeAesthetic</a> videos. In the examples they give, pay attention to how the function (the model) of the code doesn&rsquo;t change at all, but the added context (the translation) helps make the code more understandable and maintainable.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA">Don&rsquo;t Write Comments (5:54)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To take this one last step forward: when we fail to write our translations down, what we end up writing might not even match what we had in our heads. While thought is <a href="/blog/blog/knowing_vs_understanding">deep and intricate</a>, its also a by nature a <a href="/blog/learning/language_is_a_bottleneck">lossy medium</a>. Don&rsquo;t add more loss for no reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Writing the decisions down is essential. Only when one writes do the gaps appear and the inconsistencies protrude. The act of setting turns out to require hundreds of mini decisions, and if the existence of these that distinguishes clear, exact policies from the fuzzy ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; Fred Brooks, <a href="/blog/learning/the_mythical_man_month"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If writing in the model of our native tongues requires &ldquo;hundreds of mini decisions&rdquo;, imagine what happens when we try to skip directly to a foreign computational model without first distinguishing &ldquo;clear, exact policies from the fuzzy ones.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="to-summarize">To Summarize:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are fundamentally translating from a human language mental model to a computational, digital model when we write software.</li>
<li>We should always be as explicit as possible with our intentions when we write software, making clear our <em>translations</em> of the <em>models</em>, being very specific so we can:
<ul>
<li>Better communicate our intentions to our teams (and our future selves).</li>
<li>Confirm what we write matches our original intention.</li>
<li>Encapsulate those models into simple components we can easily think about the context of a system.</li>
</ul>
