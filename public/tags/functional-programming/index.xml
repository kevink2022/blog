      <description>Great introduction to many different programming concepts. Highly recommend watching the whole channel, only 90 minutes on YouTube so far. Some of my favorites:&#xA;Why You Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t Nest Your Code Highlights how simply limiting the amount you nest your code will force you to write better code.&#xA;Don&amp;rsquo;t Write Comments In a similar way to nesting, shows how most comments can be eliminated by writing code that reads like a language.</description>
