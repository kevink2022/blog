<h1 id="what-i-am-looking-for-in-an-organization">What I am looking for in an organization</h1>
<p>I understand that in an ideal world, all organizations would follow software development principles and best practices. However, we live in a unideal world of capital, competition, deadlines, and security vulnerabilities. These <em>external pressures</em> often constrict an organizations choices. Time spent preparing for the far future is time wasted if the organization might go cease to exist in the near future.</p>
<p>However, most organizations that last will find themselves in periods where those external pressures subside, and then the <em>internal pressures</em>, explicit or not, drive the further direction of the organization. I firmly believe this is where organizations truly distinguish themselves, and by following strong software principles, set themselves up for success. When the external pressures begin to ramp up, the organization that prepared in the past, and learned from its previous mistakes, and made multiplicative process improvements, will have a lot more room to maneuver. Meanwhile, the organization ignores past mistakes, and focuses entirely on the next venture, will eventually fall under its own weight, stressing all involved.</p>
<p>I understand that external pressures can demand short-term thinking. But any professional relationship I enter with an organization that either explicitly encourages permanent short-term thinking, or even worse, doesn&rsquo;t understand the implicit effects of the internal pressures they unconsciously create, will not last.</p>
<p>Some of the ways I think mature software organizations are built to last are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggressive testing, where developers aren&rsquo;t <a href="/learning/better_testing_worse_quality">too reliant on QA</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/r2BFTXBundQ?t=503&amp;si=QBm-rZdg97pn_Y2o">Fast feedback loops</a> to avoid the pitfalls of rampant speculation.</li>
<li>Introspective, learning from past mistakes, and is willing to face and fix problems instead of avoiding them.</li>
<li>Is proud of its most simple and readable code, and embarrassed by incidental complexity.</li>
<li>Embraces functional design where appropriate and is wary of the dangers of shared state change.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Software Engineer from the Philadelphia area who went to Penn State (very unique, I know), who fell in love with programming when my awesome math teacher showed the class our calculators could write programs. Before long, I would write the program that would do my homework that night before class ended (thank you again, Mrs. Zapor).</p>
<p>Outside of that, growing up I was very into sports (go birds), which culminated with me playing Volleyball in high school (go crusaders). While in high school, I fell in love with art (largely thanks to <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sulfurbunny/gallery/36148502/victory-fire-book-one">Victory Fire</a>) and music, which led me to learning how to draw and picking the piano up again. Though, shortly after drawing whats probably my <a href="/images/ben_simmons.JPG">best piece</a>, I learned I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a>, and have focused my creative energy more into creative writing as of late.</p>
<p>In college, I knew I wanted to study abroad, and found an engineering program at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, where I&rsquo;d do undergraduate research on AI. That gave me enough of a reason to learn Japanese to an intermediate level. Unfortunately, the program was called off due to covid shortly before I was set to leave. But hey, at least I can watch anime while cooking.</p>
<p>Later, sparked by finally watching Game of Thrones and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HistoriaCivilis">Historia Civilis</a> on YouTube, I have become a bit of a history buff. Highly recommend Dan Carlin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Hardcore History</a>, <a href="https://therestishistory.supportingcast.fm/">The Rest is History</a> with Tom Holland (not that one) and Dominic Sandbrook, and Mike Duncan&rsquo;s <a href="https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">The History of Rome</a> and <a href="https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/">Revolutions</a> to any podcast listeners out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now living in Sacramento for my first full time job out of college. I recently picked up guitar to go along with piano, have been getting more into cooking to eat healthier, and on have gotten into writing as a medium of thought through this blog.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This first half of this post is a personal story, adding context to how I came to these conclusions at this point in my life. If you want to jump straight to the difference between knowing and understanding, feel free to skip to <a href="#what-it-means-to-understand">what it means to understand.</a></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="we-should-really-read-more">We should really read more.</h3>
<p>I was hanging out with US Air Force officers, at the invite of a friend who himself is an officer. We got on the topic about reading, specifically how we all really should read more. Someone made a comment about how the most successful, high ranking officers they knew always seemed to be reading something, and always had a whole bookshelf in their office.</p>
<p>The cynical side of me wanted to say something about how reading all those books is impossible unless you have something driving you more then the vain, ephemeral idea of &lsquo;success.&rsquo; For most people, at least.</p>
<p>At the time, I assumed that drive had to come from some innate interest or curiosity, that had to be there before you ever started learning about the topic. That most of these high ranking officers were, whether they knew it or not, in some way interested in how organizations work and how to effectively lead, and combining that with them being put into a position to lead and/or picking up their first book on the topic, started their pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>I now understand that this line of thinking was an artifact of the &lsquo;fixed mindset,&rsquo; (basically the opposite of a &lsquo;growth mindset&rsquo;) that I had just recently recognized was slowing me down. Because I had no issue reading, I&rsquo;ve read entire <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> books in less than 2 weeks. But it was a deep interest in the story, the world, and pre-modern societies in general that fueled my rabid reading. Without that underlying interest being awoken, there&rsquo;s no way I would read hundreds of pages or blow through hours of content on something as boring as how to run an organization.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-life-of-knowing">A life of knowing</h3>
<p>I was always very, very successful in school with very little effort. I was consistently called the smartest person in the room. While I&rsquo;m sure people understood that this may create a massive ego problem (and it very much did), what I&rsquo;m sure what they didn&rsquo;t understand was how they were setting me up to be very conservative in my future endeavors.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is described in detail in Carol Dweck&rsquo;s writings on <a href="https://ctl.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj17446/files/media/file/growth_mindset_handout.pdf">growth mindset</a>, but to sum it up, when people are praised, believe it or not, it makes them happy. Unsurprisingly, this drives them towards behavior directed at continuing to receiving that praise.</p>
<p>The catch is, when people are praised for their <em>intrinsic</em> traits, such as how smart or talented they are, that doesn&rsquo;t encourage them to seek harder challenges, outside their comfort zone. In fact, the opposite usually happens - they seek easier challenges. To them, failure makes them question their own identity and the self-worth that they based on that identity (I can vouch for that). Now, when you praise people for their <em>extrinsic</em> trait of <em>effort</em>, something they can directly control, well you can imagine how their behavior might differ.</p>
<p>I took pride in my ability to not just cram, but often gave people awful advice to not spend so much time trying to <em>understand</em>. You really didn&rsquo;t need to understand why, for example, the derivative of <code>cos(x)</code> was <code>-sin(x)</code>. That was just another tool in your toolbox that you needed to <em>know.</em></p>
<p>And so I continued through school and graduated college with honors, but always struggled to accomplish anything outside of my coursework. However, I always found excuses for this lack of production, cause I was just too smart to fail, I had just failed to manage my time with my coursework. But then I graduated 6 months early, and took those 6 months off to finally do something with my life.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="beginning-to-understand">Beginning to understand</h3>
<p>My main goal at the end of those 6 months was to have an app on the iOS App Store. Not a super lofty goal, but I wanted a real, useful app, not just some gimmick. I had taken the Swift UI class at Penn State, so felt that I knew everything I needed to <em>know</em> to clean up my rushed final project, which was <a href="/tags/boomic/">Boomic Music</a>. But that was such a mess, as I has rushed to get as many features done during class, didn&rsquo;t spend any time on architecture, and skipped a lot of the hard problems. So I quickly pivoted to something easier: a workout app. Then I pivoted about 3-4 more times over the next few months.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t really pull any lessons out of those 6 months, other than to just focus on one project at a time, because I was just making the same mistakes over and over again. The real problem was that, of course, the 3 credit class I took was nowhere near enough to build an app on the scale I wanted. And I was <em>really</em> impatient. When I ran into something I didn&rsquo;t know, I wanted to know it as soon as possible and move on. Just like when I was doing my homework or studying for a test.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the end of 2023, a year since I graduated. I was six months into a very unfulfilling implementation consultant role, and had nothing to put on my resume to give me hope about that changing any time soon. I made a few commitments to myself (such as committing to a growth mindset), and after stumbling upon an article on <a href="/learning/ten_things_about_learning/">10 Things Software Developers Should Learn about Learning</a>, I committed to two more things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually learning how to architect an app by taking my time and reading as much source code/learning materials as possible</li>
<li>Focus 100% of my creative energy on finally building Boomic. No more pivoting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The single text that kick-started my understanding of mobile architectures was Jacob Bartlett&rsquo;s blog post on <a href="https://jacobbartlett.substack.com/p/modular-architecture-for-apps">Modular Architecture for Apps</a>. Following the layered architecture, development was going much better then it had in the past, and I had some newfound confidence. Until I had to throw out 3 weeks of work due to some poor assumptions I made. The familiar fears of of failure and wasted time began to well up inside me.</p>
<p>But this time, with a growth mindset, I really reflected on what went wrong, and learned from my mistakes. Oh, and I discovered Rich Hickey.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I went ahead an consumed almost every talk that man has given, and most the keynotes twice. I consistently had better ideas of how to compose my app, both during the talks and in the days after. These presentations, mostly from over a decade ago before the Swift language existed, without a line of source code, gave me so much insight and confidence to write Swift code. It gave me a deeper <em>understanding</em> of what I was building.</p>
<p>This may seem obvious, that there can be wisdom in old material. But for my past self, I just wanted to learn things once. I just wanted to know, so I could do, and move on. And if we&rsquo;re all standing on the shoulders of giants, wouldn&rsquo;t that wisdom get passed to me in the new material anyway?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-it-means-to-understand">What it means to understand.</h3>
<p>My aversion to reading older material came from my impatience and desire to just <em>know</em>. Just like how I didn&rsquo;t care to know <em>why</em> the derivative of <code>cos(x)</code> was <code>-sin(x)</code>, I just wanted to know the best mobile architecture for the type of app I&rsquo;m making. Or the best database to use. Or the best <em>insert solution here</em> for <em>insert current problem here</em>. If someone had made the mistake of giving me a leadership position, if I didn&rsquo;t arrogantly assume I already knew what I was doing, I would buy a brand new bestselling book on that topic. Certainly, the author had read the last bestseller, who&rsquo;s author had read the last bestseller, and so on. And through that magical chain, all of the knowledge of the past would be bestowed upon me, who is certainly smart enough to put it to effective use.</p>
<p>But I now finally understand why simply knowing is insufficient. Because its simply <em>impossible</em> to ever understand and truly grasp complex topics from one perspective.</p>
<p>Now, if I was in the Matrix and could be plugged directly into that authors brain, maybe then I could actually understand in one go. But we don&rsquo;t live in the Matrix, and as Marco Giancotti aptly paints with that example, <a href="https://aethermug.com/posts/language-is-a-bottleneck-for-thought">language is a bottleneck for thought</a>. While visual mediums might help a lot (a picture is worth a thousand words), as of now, we still have no way to communicate the exact intricacies of our mental models of the world to others. Through trying to start writing blog posts, I&rsquo;ve learned just how futile that can feel.</p>
<p>I felt like my world opened up and I finally understood software design after watching Rich Hickey&rsquo;s <a href="/learning/simple_made_easy">Simple Made Easy</a>, but then I watched his <a href="/learning/simplicity_matters">Simplicity Matters</a>, basically the same talk given later, and was surprised how much more I learned. Then I went back and watched the original again, and realized there was so much more I missed.</p>
<p>Listening to Ron Westrum talk about generative organizations on <a href="/learning/idealcast">The Idealcast</a>, again I felt like my world opened up, and I finally understood what made some organizations great (and why work in a bureaucratic organization could feel so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">&lsquo;Sisyphusian&rsquo;</a>).  But then, I listened to Elisabeth Hendrickson and Steven Spear&rsquo;s first appearances on the show, and not only did it give me a deeper understanding, but it affirmed and built on so much of what Ron Westrum had described in his episodes.</p>
<p>And all the sudden, just like those high ranking officers we all wanted to emulate, I found my bookshelf full of books.</p>
<p>It was when I started reading the classic <a href="/learning/the_mythical_man_month"><em>The Mythical-Man Month</em></a> that the difference between knowing and understanding really clicked. I would have never considered reading this book in the past, with it being released all the way back in 1975. I mean c&rsquo;mon, even the way software was developed in the 90s seemed like a nightmare (git was released in <em>2005!</em>), what could this guy know?</p>
<p>But when I was reading it, I found myself constantly making connections to what I had learned previously from Rich Hickey and the Idealcast. Not only was I reading things that affirmed those lessons, but it was reading things that at first seemed to go against my model of the world that made me think the hardest and taught me the most. Things that made me <em>challenge</em> my understanding of the world. And at the end, I had a better understanding.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, while it might feel like we think in words, our brains are enormous neural networks with billions of lossy nodes. Even the most prolific thinkers and writers in human history couldn&rsquo;t possibly communicate the complete and deep understanding that they&rsquo;ve built up through <em>any</em> medium. No matter how many times I listen to everything Rich Hickey has ever said, despite his best efforts, I will never see and understand the world the way he does.</p>
<p>Only through our own constant learning and experience can we hope to build up our own, unique, but just as deep, understanding. As long as we are constantly receiving new inputs, whether through experience, classes, lectures, keynotes, blogs, or the books on our cool bookshelves we originally bought to make us look smart, we can train our neural networks to have as rich and through of an understanding as the leaders we admire and want to emulate.</p>
<p>And for all the impatient knowers out there who just want to get stuff done, take it from one of your own. To master a complex topic like software, and to really do it right, you need to learn how to <em>understand</em>, or you&rsquo;ll never become that expert who just gets stuff done. After all,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beginners Reason, Experts Recognize.</p>
<p>&mdash; <a href="/learning/ten_things_about_learning/">10 Things Software Developers Should Learn about Learning</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why those officers have all those books.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="is-there-still-room-for-knowing">Is there still room for knowing?</h3>
<p>Yes, that was not rhetorical. Before we can understand something, we need to know as much as possible. I only made those deep connections reading Mythical Man-Month because I had remembered what Rich Hickey, Elisabeth Hendrickson, and Steven Spear had said. It was those connections between what I knew that lead to understanding. I think the general &rsquo;three pillars&rsquo; model of language learning I acquired while I learned Japanese in college applies here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn the words, so you know what the they&rsquo;re saying.</li>
<li>Learn the grammar, so you understand how those words go together.</li>
<li>Engage with the language as much as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>I needed to know the words and the grammar, so I could engage with the language and build those connections of deep understanding.</p>
<p>But we really need to be conscious of what we&rsquo;re doing, and why we&rsquo;re doing it. We don&rsquo;t want to waste our time trying to apply an understanding strategy on things we should just know. Like with Japanese words: there was no getting around it, I needed to memorize the words. I needed to just know them, and the grammar rules, so when I heard a sentence, I could make the connections and understand the sentence.</p>
<p>This is a mistake I see my current organization making. Our product is a Goliath of an accounting program. If theres any clear, up-to-date documentation of the inner workings of the system, they haven&rsquo;t been shared with me (even a lot of the <em>source code</em> is even hidden from most devs). Instead, they encourage people build a deep understanding of <em>where</em> the code is or <em>where</em> a fix should be to align with the current system. This may sound confusing, but we store a lot of &lsquo;configuration code&rsquo; in a relational SQL database, all our classes have 5-8 letter code names which communicate nothing about what the class is actually doing, and all communication between classes is done in opaque messages. Basically, to make any changes, whether adding something or fixing a bug, the procedure is to go to that part of the system in the GUI and &lsquo;figure out&rsquo; where to make the changes.</p>
<p>And so it really does take a decade plus to build a true, deep understanding of how this system works. I&rsquo;ve met people who&rsquo;ve done it, its as impressive as it is tragic. Specific system configuration sits squarely on the <em>know</em> side of the fence, and the ease of access to that information needs to be highly optimized for. What&rsquo;s is on the other side of the fence is <em>understanding</em> how different system architectures and configurations are better for certain use cases, and the emerging properties they will have when deployed at scale. That takes seeing and experiencing many different configurations before that understanding will ever be built up. Unfortunately, most members of my organization have spent their entire career with this system, and therefore struggle to even imagine any alternatives.</p>
<p>I started my <a href="/learning/">learning collection</a> at the end of last year, to collect all information I wanted to wanted, and be able to go back too, so I could understand the complex topic of software. I now have a folder for software engineering, leadership, languages, writing, music, and life. Only recently have I realized the true power in that has been how it optimized the speed of knowing, so I could finally build deep understandings of complex topics.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="to-summarize">To Summarize:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is impossible to understand a complex topic from a single source, due to the bottlenecks of our communication mediums. So to understand complex topics, we need to be constantly learning and taking in as much input as possible to build up our internal neural networks and our mental models of the world. There&rsquo;s no way around that.</li>
<li>We need to be conscious of what needs deep understanding to be effective at, and what should just be known. Then, we need to optimize for quick and easy access to what should be known.</li>
</ul>

I was closely following the architecture of their <a href="https://github.com/jacobsapps/bev17/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file">Bev Sample App</a>, using the Repository pattern, featured in his series on <a href="https://jacobbartlett.substack.com/p/async-unit-testing-in-swift-the-comprehensive">Async Unit Testing</a>. I highly recommend <a href="https://jacobbartlett.substack.com/">Jacobs Tech Tavern</a> to any iOS app developers.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Repository Pattern&rsquo; is where you create a single <code>Repository</code> component that serves the data to the UI. The UI doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about where the data is coming from, while the repository can combine data from different sources. In Bev, Jacob shows a use case of grabbing local, cached data from a database, while fetching the most up-to-date data from an API. Here&rsquo;s cut down version of what this looks like:</p>

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>My first goal for Boomic was to simply load audio files from a local directory into a <code>Database</code> as <code>Song</code> objects, then load them from the database onto the UI. I needed some kind of <code>MediaFileInterface</code> to load audio files from a directory and extract their metadata into the <code>Song</code> objects. Thinking that the database was likely the only thing that needed to load files this way, as the rest of my app could just deal with <code>Song</code> objects, I went with a design like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/original_database.svg" alt="Original Database with coupled file interface"></p>
<p>It was after watching Rich Hickey&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCwqnjxqfmY">Design, Composition, and Performance</a> that I realized what kind of mistake I was making with the database.</p>
<p>I thought that simply by using Swift&rsquo;s protocols, I was keeping these components decoupled. I could easily switch from a local to a remote directory with the same <code>MediaFileInterface</code> protocol. But I was still coupling the Database to the fact that it had to know where it was getting its <code>Song</code> objects from. This would&rsquo;ve have flown under my radar, until I thought about Apple Music. A long-term goal of Boomic is to be able to sync your Apple Music library alongside your local library. Since I want to have the same tags and ratings for both Apple Music and local songs, I wanted to store them in the same database. Assuming I did that that now, the database would look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/original_database_expanded.svg" alt="Original Database with two coupled file interfaces"></p>
<p>I would need to edit the database itself, its public interface, and the repository that calls it. By just making the database aware of a protocol to get new songs, I was giving the database an extra responsibility: don&rsquo;t just store the songs, but get the new ones as well. Lets remove that separate responsibility and see what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/images/decoupled_database.svg" alt="Update, decoupled database with separate file interface"></p>
<p>Now, the <code>Repository</code> can simply have two different functions for each different source. The <code>Database</code> itself can be designed in a much simpler, more generic manner, without worrying where it is getting new data from. More importantly, when I want to add the Apple Music support, I only have to change the app-specific <code>Repository</code>, instead of making my way down the stack, adjusting each component to fit the new use case. I simply a write a new composition of a new component, the <code>AppleMusicInterface</code> and an old one, the <code>Database</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="breaking-it-down-composers-and-instruments">Breaking it down: Composers and Instruments</h3>
<p>I really liked the general repository pattern, and felt it could be extended outside the realm of data operations. As I mentioned earlier, it was watching the aforementioned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCwqnjxqfmY">Design, Composition, and Performance</a> when the value of the repository pattern really clicked. So, lets borrow some vocabulary (albeit in a slightly different way) and see how it feels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instruments:</strong> Single responsibility, usually generic components.</li>
<li><strong>Composers</strong>: Components that coordinate one or more instruments to achieve something specific.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my app so far, the <code>Database</code>, <code>MediaFileInterface</code>, <code>AppleMusicInterface</code>, and any other sources of data such as an <code>ImageCache</code> are the instruments. Each instrument does their specific tasks, is completely decoupled from the others, and can be reused in other parts of the program (for example, using <code>AppleMusicInterface</code> to grab the rest of an album from one song in the library). Then, the <code>Repository</code> is a composer that handles the specific needs of my app by, well, composing these instruments together.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="composers-as-instruments">Composers as Instruments.</h3>
<p>I want to make one thing about this design philosophy clear: Just because something is an instrument, doesn&rsquo;t mean it cannot be composed of other instruments. An example of this is how I am currently storing transactions.</p>
<p>To store transactions as they&rsquo;re received, I built a generic <code>LogStore</code> class that saves <code>Codable</code> objects at a key in the order they&rsquo;re received, like a standard log. This is pretty clearly an instrument: single-responsibility, generic, ready to be composed into various purpose specific components. But the <code>LogStore</code> itself was composed with another instrument: the <code>SimpleStore</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>SimpleStore</code> itself just saves and overwrites the object saved at its key. So the most basic implementation of a <code>LogStore&lt;T&gt;</code> can just use a single <code>SimpleStore&lt;[T]&gt;</code>, which is exactly what I have done for now as my proof-of-concept:</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">final</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">LogStore</span>&lt;Log: Loggable&gt; {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">self</span>.storage = SimpleStore(key: key)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#66d9ef">public</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">func</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">save</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">_</span> log: Log) async <span style="color:#66d9ef">throws</span> {

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">var</span> logs = pastLogs ?? []
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        logs.insert(log, at: <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>        <span style="color:#66d9ef">try</span> await storage.save(logs)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>	<span style="color:#75715e">/* ... */</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is pretty inefficient, since as logs are written to disk right away. A better version of this would be using multiple simple stores, with a cache <code>SimpleStore</code> for quickly saving of the most recent logs, and then periodically merging them in with the older logs from another <code>SimpleStore</code> in the background. Either way, the <code>LogStore</code> here an example of a composer: composing one or more instances of the generic <code>SimpleStore</code> instrument. But, it itself is a generic, composable instrument, that I use to store transactions now, and probably logs in the future.</p>
<p>I think Rich Hickey really illustrates this point well at from <a href="https://youtu.be/QCwqnjxqfmY?t=2479&amp;si=jhGajdysPBKZE5As">41:19-42:42</a> in, you guessed it, Design, Composition, and Performance! <a href="https://www.arturia.com/stories/yvesusson-insideamodularmind">Yves Usson</a>, who designed the synthesizer, composed the it out of machines that themselves individual instruments, or at least would be in this current model. Then, the synthesizer itself is available to musicians to use in composition with other instruments.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="isnt-this-obvious">Isn&rsquo;t this obvious?</h3>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this just another way of saying &lsquo;we should be building composable systems?&rsquo; Yeah, pretty much, but I think there is a lot of value in reframing the way we think about our systems with specific terminology and strong analogies. In just writing this post and applying this thinking to the system that inspired it, I realized that the <code>MediaFileInterface</code>, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily violate the Single Responsibility Principle (translate all the files in a root directory into <code>Song</code> objects), is both not generalizable, and could be broken apart into two separate, more generalizable, instruments.</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// old</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> newSongs = MediaFileInterface().newSongs(existing: existingSongs)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">// new</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> knownFiles = existingSongs.map { $0.file }
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> newFiles = FileInterface().all([<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;mp3&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;flac&#34;</span>], ignoring: knownFiles)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">let</span> newSongs = newFiles.map { Song(fromFile: $0) }</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For me, it really is that reframing that can bring a lot of value. I was comfortable calling the <code>MediaFileInterface</code> a simple, single responsibility component that only had one public function, and it was only 60 lines. But it was a specific component I built for a specific purpose. When I want to play guitar in a new key, do I buy a whole new guitar? No, I take my existing guitar, and just put on, <em>or compose it with,</em> a capo!</p>
<p>So, after reframing the question, I was not comfortable calling the <code>MediaFileInterface</code> a good instrument. Which led me to asking &ldquo;Could this be composed of simpler instruments?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Could this be more generic?&rdquo; and ended with me building the new, more generic <code>FileInterface</code>, which I am already using in another part of the <code>Repository</code>.</p>
<p>To summarize, I think we can build the vast majority of what we create with generic instruments and a few composers. Whenever we do something specific, we should try to break it down into generic instruments, and build those instruments with simpler and simpler parts. This will give us many a huge toolbox to compose with, and we can easily write tests for most of the instruments, giving our compositions strong foundations.</p>

<h3 id="in-practice">In Practice</h3>
<p>Finally back to the app, what does Boomic look like today. I am still some time away from the MVP, and so plan on updating this part of the post down the road. Especially if (more likely when) I find I didn&rsquo;t have as complete of an understanding as I thought I had. But here is the current structure, still relatively flat but much, much less coupled then its predecessor:</p>
<p><img src="/images/boomic_arc.svg" alt="boomic_architecture"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Repository</code></strong>: Composer of the data instruments, specifically for the UI.
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Transactor</code></strong>: Serially stores library transactions, and publishes a new <code>DataBasis</code> to reflect that transaction.
<ul>
<li><strong><code>DataBasis</code></strong>: Immutable value of the entire library.  Progression of state tracked by the <code>Transactor</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>QueryEngine</code></strong>: Queries a <code>DataBasis</code>.</li>
<li><strong><code>FileInterface</code></strong>: Provides enumerations of specified file extensions from a root directory.</li>
<li><strong><code>MetadataLoader</code></strong>: Extracts metadata from audio files, both embedded and from the surrounding files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Player</code></strong>: Composer of the audio playback instruments. Has a fair amount of state.
<ul>
<li><strong><code>Engine</code></strong>: The interface to the library that makes the system calls to playback audio. Each song gets its own engine, allowing for pre-loading.</li>
<li><strong><code>Queue</code></strong>: An immutable value representing the queue. Progression of state tracked by the <code>Player</code>.</li>
<li><strong><code>Mixer</code></strong>: Applies EQ and Effects to the <code>Engine</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>ImageCache</code></strong>: Shared cache, keys embedded album art with MD5 hashes to prevent initializing the same images over and over.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="immediate-plans">Immediate Plans</h5>
<ul>
<li>Create a <code>LiveQueryEngine</code> that tracks changes and updates views when the <code>DataBasis</code> updates.</li>
<li>Have the <code>Player</code> directly access the <code>Repository</code> instead of just sharing the <code>ImageCache</code> so it can respond to <code>DataBasis</code> updates.</li>
<li>Look into making the <code>QueryEngine</code>, <code>MetadataLoader</code>,  <code>Engine</code>, and <code>Queue</code> classes more generic. They all currently rely on this app&rsquo;s custom data types (even if by name only), such as <code>Song</code> or <code>DataBasis</code> objects. From the instrument/composer point of view, this is generally bad practice, though may be unavoidable in certain cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more work to do to make the immutable <code>DataBasis</code> pattern work with Swifts observation frameworks, and make the UI reactive to specific changes. I have reflected on whether keeping the pattern is worth it and have decided to continue it. More on why I am storing data this way in a future blogpost.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was having a conversation with a friend the other day, who like many people that get paid to write code, has no background in computer science. They were talking about how their employer wanted them to learn C# (they had mostly been using python) for a potential .NET app, and so they had paid for a C# course.</p>
<p>While this makes sense as one of the quickest ways to get up to speed with a certain language, I recommended they pay attention to and learn the fundamental constructs that C#  shares with Python, and where it differs.</p>
<p>Most professional programmers and software engineers have used, or at least dabbled with, many different languages throughout their careers, to the point where switching to another language becomes almost trivial. We can design systems with these fundamental constructs, then implement them in these different languages.</p>
<p>Once we obtain that deep understanding of fundamental constructs, we can become very confident and proud of our ability to &rsquo;think in computer.&rsquo; Which is essential, we are writing for computers after all. But we often fail to see the drawbacks in limiting our thinking like that. I knew that we should strive for clean, &lsquo;readable&rsquo; code, but I didn&rsquo;t truly understand the essence of that goal until I tried to think in another spoken language.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="to-understand-or-to-be-understood">To understand or to be understood.</h3>
<p>The Japanese word that inspired this line of thinking was åãã (pronounced <em>wakaru</em>), which is a verb that <em>translates</em> to &rsquo;to understand.&rsquo; I had learned it a few years back in college in preparation to study abroad, but covid had other plans for my time in college. Now as a graduate, I decided to start learning Japanese again because it was quite fun, and I no longer in a rush to learn it all within two years.</p>
<p>One of the many details I often brushed pass the first time around whether verbs were <em>intransitive</em> or <em>transitive</em>, which describes whether or not the verb is performed by the subject (intransitive) on itself or on a direct object (transitive). Basically, in the sentence &lsquo;<em>I</em> am running,&rsquo; running is intransitive, because I, the subject, is what is running. While in the sentence &lsquo;I am running the <em>dishwasher,</em>&rsquo; running is transitive, because I, the subject, am performing the verb on the dishwasher, the direct object.</p>
<p>To my horror, I realized åãã was intransitive. In my many conversations (mostly with myself, I have been terrified to make this exact kind of mistake online) I have had in Japanese these last few years, I have been using åãã wrong, as a transitive verb.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B">Wanikani explanation</a> of the word says it best, so I&rsquo;ll just quote it in here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This word means to <em>understand</em>, which might surprise you if you remember that the kanji å means <em>part</em>. Think of it this way: to understand something you have to break it down into its parts to see how it works.</p>
<p>Watch out, though, because whereas in English you understand something, in Japanese the thing you understand is the grammatical subject (it&rsquo;s doing the action). So, a more literal meaning for this is <em>to be understandable</em>. In other words, there&rsquo;s no object, and åãã is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The ãã ending is a hint, because verbs with ãã as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me, this is a completely different <em>mental model</em>, almost a different way of thinking. Lets borrow that word <em>model</em> and take a look at at what I mean. If I wanted to say &lsquo;I understand that book&rsquo; in Japanese, I would sayããã®æ¬ãåãã.ãLets break that down real quick:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&lsquo;Word&rsquo;</th>
<th>Pronounciation</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ãã®</td>
<td>sono</td>
<td>that (thing)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>æ¬</td>
<td>hon</td>
<td>book</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ã</td>
<td>ga</td>
<td>subject marker, marking ãã®æ¬ as the subject</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>åãã</td>
<td>wakaru</td>
<td>to be understandable</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So then, lets take a look at how the models differ in each language:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th><em>Model</em></th>
<th>In a sentance</th>
<th>Translation of the <em>model</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To understand</td>
<td>To understand</td>
<td>I understand that book</td>
<td>ãã®æ¬ãåãã (grammatically incorrect)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>åãã</td>
<td><em>To be understandable</em></td>
<td>ãã®æ¬ãåãã</td>
<td>That book is understandable.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The only difference between the correct sentence, and the one I would&rsquo;ve said, is that I would have replaced ã, the &lsquo;subject marker,&rsquo; with ã, the &lsquo;direct object marker.&rsquo; Instead of the book, I as the speaker would implicitly be the subject of that sentence. Which, of course, is a grammatically incorrect use of the Japanese verb, but makes perfect sense to me if I am using my English model. Now, when I do my Wanikani flashcards, I always try and take care to answer with the meaning that&rsquo;s the closest <em>model</em> to the word, which is not necessarily the closest <em>translation.</em></p>
<p>This fundamental difference in the modeling everyday situations is reflected even stronger in the closest translations of the words &rsquo;to like&rsquo; and &rsquo;to want,&rsquo; which are å¥½ã (pronounced suki) and æ¬²ãã (pronounced hoshii) respectively. You might be thinking, &ldquo;Are they not just like åãã in the previous example, where they&rsquo;re just intransitive verbs?&rdquo; Nope, they&rsquo;re <em><strong>adjectives</strong></em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th><em>Model</em></th>
<th>In a sentance</th>
<th>Translation of the <em>model</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To like</td>
<td>To like</td>
<td>I like that book</td>
<td>ãã®æ¬ãå¥½ãã  (<em>very</em> grammatically incorrect)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>å¥½ã</td>
<td>is likeable</td>
<td>ãã®æ¬ãå¥½ãã </td>
<td>That book is likeable.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I absolutely could not wrap my head around this general model when I first learned it. When we use adjectives in English, we are generally either saying n objective fact, or we preface our subjective opinions with the fact that they are, well, opinions. I mean, if you were struggling to grasp some LeetCode problem and asked me for help, and I walked over and said &lsquo;That problem is understandable.&rsquo; You might think I&rsquo;m insulting you!</p>
<p>But Japanese is a <em>heavily</em> context based language. So when I say a thing is understandable, it is generally understood to be my point of view of the situation, not a comment on whether the thing is easy to understand.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="but-what-does-this-have-to-do-with-programming-languages">But what does this have to do with programming languages?</h3>
<p>I think the weight of the word <em>language</em> in programming <em>language</em> is often lost on us. Just like how I have to rewire my brain to think in a Japanese model, I had to do the same when I was first learning to program, just in a model of computation. Thinking in variables, if/else blocks, and loops. But unlike when I use my English model in a Japanese sentence, using an unclear or incorrect model to solve a problem might not just be harmless little grammar mistakes, but could have real world consequences. Even if you&rsquo;re confident in you and your team&rsquo;s ability to &rsquo;think in computer,&rsquo; you should have no faith in their ability to &lsquo;<em>communicate</em> in computer.&rsquo; Similar to Japanese, programming languages themselves can be dangerously context dependent, and far too much can get lost in translation.</p>
<p>Think back to the explanation of those Japanese sentences. Presuming you&rsquo;re a native English speaker, to understand the meaning of the Japanese sentences, you needed to know both:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the sentence was built via the <em>Japanese model.</em></li>
<li>The message being communicated via the <em>English translation.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I think the same thing is going on whenever we write programs. We build our code &lsquo;sentences&rsquo; in a <em>computer model</em> to be executed. But the computer isn&rsquo;t the only one who needs to understand our code: people need to as well.</p>
<p>So, we need to focus on being explicit in the intention of our code by including translation, the actual meaning we&rsquo;re trying to communicate, <em>within</em> the code.</p>
<p>Remember the mistranslation that can occur from earlier if we tried to communicate with a different model:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;That problem is understandable.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>(Is he insulting me?)</em> &ldquo;I think its pretty difficult.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These same mistranslations can occur when we try and communicate in computer models. A dead simple example (imagine this is an in-house sleep with no documentation):</p>

<p>Whats far more likely then a simple mistranslation, and what I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve encountered many more times, is when there is <em>nothing</em> to translate. When your reading some code and you sit there, thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What on <em>earth</em> were they trying to do here? What could their intention possibly have been?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, all bets are off, who knows if your going to translate that code correctly.</p>
<p>I could take the time to come up with some more examples, but I would highly recommend taking the time to watch these two <a href="/learning/code_aesthetic">CodeAesthetic</a> videos. Their examples are much more engaging then what I&rsquo;d come up with, and I think are both videos getting after this core idea. In all of the examples they give, notice how the function (the model) of the code doesn&rsquo;t change at all, but the added context (the translation) helps make the code more understandable and maintainable.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J3wNP6u5YU">Naming Things in Code (7:24)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7vDBBOBUA">Don&rsquo;t Write Comments (5:54)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To take this one last step forward: when we fail to write our translations down, what we end up writing might not even match what we had in our heads. While thought is <a href="/blog/knowing_vs_understanding">deep and intricate</a>, its also a by nature a <a href="/learning/language_is_a_bottleneck">lossy medium</a>. Don&rsquo;t add more loss for no reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Writing the decisions down is essential. Only when one writes do the gaps appear and the inconsistencies protrude. The act of setting turns out to require hundreds of mini decisions, and if the existence of these that distinguishes clear, exact policies from the fuzzy ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; Fred Brooks, <a href="/learning/the_mythical_man_month"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If writing in our model of our native tongues requires &ldquo;hundreds of mini decisions&rdquo;, imagine what happens when we try to skip directly to a foreign computational model without first distinguishing &ldquo;clear, exact policies from the fuzzy ones.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="to-summarize">To Summarize:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are fundamentally translating from a human language mental model of the computational, digital model when we write software.</li>
<li>We should always be as explicit as possible with our intentions when we write software, making clear our <em>translations</em> of the <em>models</em>, being very specific so we can:
<ul>
<li>Better communicate our intentions to our teams (and our future selves).</li>
<li>Confirm what we write matches our original intention.</li>
<li>Encapsulate those models into simple components we can think about in a whole system.</li>
</ul>

      <description>Simple Made Easy An absolute classic, which I have watched at least once a month since I first saw it. I think anyone writing software without understanding the fundamental difference between simple and easy that Rich articulates in this talk is destined to make some serious mistakes. This general concept of simple vs easy has to be the biggest influence on how I think not just about software, but pretty much everything, and it was the key that finally unblocked me from writing large systems without inevitable &amp;lsquo;inviting the elephant&amp;rsquo; as Rich describes in 2012 follow-up Simplicity Matters.</description>
