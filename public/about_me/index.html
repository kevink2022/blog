  <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Software Engineer from the Philadelphia area who went to Penn State (very unique, I know), who fell in love with programming in middle school when my awesome math teacher showed the class our calculators could write programs. Before long, I would write the program that would do that night&rsquo;s homework before class ended (thank you again, Mrs. Zapor).</p>
<p>Outside of that, growing up I was very into sports (go birds), which culminated with me playing Volleyball in high school (go crusaders). While in high school, I fell in love with art (largely thanks to <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/sulfurbunny/gallery/36148502/victory-fire-book-one">Victory Fire</a>) and music, which led me to learning how to draw and picking the piano up again. Though, shortly after drawing whats probably my <a href="/blog/images/ben_simmons.JPG">best piece</a>, I learned I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a>, and have focused my creative energy more into creative writing as of late.</p>
<p>In college, I knew I wanted to study abroad, and found an engineering program at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, where I&rsquo;d do undergraduate research on AI. That gave me enough of a reason to learn Japanese to an intermediate level. Unfortunately, the program was called off due to covid shortly before I was set to leave. But hey, at least I can watch anime while cooking.</p>
<p>Later, sparked by finally watching Game of Thrones and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HistoriaCivilis">Historia Civilis</a> on YouTube, I have become a bit of a history buff. Highly recommend Dan Carlin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Hardcore History</a>, <a href="https://therestishistory.supportingcast.fm/">The Rest is History</a> with Tom Holland (not that one) and Dominic Sandbrook, and Mike Duncan&rsquo;s <a href="https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">The History of Rome</a> and <a href="https://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/revolutions_podcast/">Revolutions</a> to any podcast listeners out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m now living in Sacramento for my first full time job out of college. I recently picked up guitar to go along with piano, have been getting more into cooking to eat healthier, and on have gotten into writing as a medium of thought through this blog.</p>
