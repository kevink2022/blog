<h1 id="what-i-am-looking-for-in-a-team">What I am looking for in a team</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everything you do you are ignorant about in some way&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash; Dr. Steven Spear<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point in my career, my number one priority is to learn as much as possible. I hope this site has been a good representation of that. I have collected the learning materials most influential on my thinking, explored and solidified my understanding through my blog posts, and applied those lessons in my daily work and personal projects.</p>
<p>But what I am missing most is the most powerful learning source of all: a passionate team of fellow learners. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly hope to correct my false assumptions and build a better model of the world any quicker than being surrounded by smart people trying to do the same thing.</p>
<p>I am looking for a team who is hungry for knowledge, and gets excited about the lessons that can be learned from failure. That understands learning and writing software are iterative processes that require constant effort, change, and experimentation. And is aware that in everything they do, they are ignorant about in some way.</p>
<p>What are we doing here if we&rsquo;re not trying to meet interesting people and do interesting things?</p>

<p>From Dr. Spear&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4XMoHhireY">Discovering Your Way to Greatness</a> talk at DevOps Summit 2019. He was talking about how Toyota became the best car manufacturer in the world by admitting their ignorance, and building a culture that attacked it. The exact quote is &ldquo;Everything you do you are ignorant about in some <em>fashion</em>,&rdquo; at 14:08. But <em>some way</em> ended up in my notes, and I like it better now.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
