  <p>The vocab word that &lsquo;planted the seed&rsquo; that sprouted into this post was 分かる (wakaru), which is a verb that translates to &rsquo;to understand.&rsquo; This is a word I certainly didn&rsquo;t forget in the last few years. But one of the many details I often forgot the first times around was <em>intransitive</em> vs <em>transitive</em> verbs, which describes whether or not the verb is performed by the subject (intransitive) or on the direct object (transitive) by a subject. And to my horror, I realized 分かる was intransitive*. In my many conversations (mostly with myself) I have had in Japanese these last few years, I have been using 分かる wrong, as a transitive verb.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B">Wanikani explanation</a> of the word says it best, so I&rsquo;ll just quote it in here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This word means to <em>understand</em>, which might surprise you if you remember that the kanji 分 means <em>part</em>. Think of it this way: to understand something you have to break it down into its parts to see how it works.</p>
<p>Watch out, though, because whereas in English you understand something, in Japanese the thing you understand is the grammatical subject (it&rsquo;s doing the action). So, a more literal meaning for this is <em>to be understandable</em>. In other words, there&rsquo;s no object, and 分かる is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The かる ending is a hint, because verbs with かる as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th>Idea</th>
<th>In a sentance</th>
<th>Direct translation of the <em>idea</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>To understand</td>
<td>To understand</td>
<td>I understand that book</td>
<td>その本を分かる (Grammatically incorrect)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>分かる</td>
<td><em>To be understandable</em></td>
<td>その本が分かる</td>
<td>That book is understandable.</td>
</tr>

<p>Breaking down the sentence:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>&lsquo;Word&rsquo;</th>
<th>Pronounciation</th>
<th>Meaning</th>

<td>その</td>

<td>book</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>が</td>
<td>ga</td>
<td>subject marker</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>分かる</td>
<td>wakaru</td>
<td>to be understandable</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The &lsquo;subject marker&rsquo;, が, is a particle that &lsquo;marks&rsquo; the preceding clause as the subject of the sentence. So その本, or &rsquo;that book&rsquo; is the subject of sentence.</p>
<p>The only difference between the correct sentence, and the sentence I would&rsquo;ve said, is that I would have replaced が, the &lsquo;subject marker,&rsquo; with を, the &lsquo;direct object marker.&rsquo; Instead of the book, I as the speaker am implicitly the subject of the sentence.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, because I wasn&rsquo;t thinking in Japanese, but just applying my native English mental model derived from the translation, not the core <em>idea</em>, I made a mistake.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="to-desire-or-to-be-desirable">To desire or to be desirable</h1>
<p>The first real mental model curveball a native English speaker will have to wrangle with when learning Japanese are the words for &rsquo;to like&rsquo; and &rsquo;to want,&rsquo; which translate to 好き (suki) and 欲しい (hoshii) respectively. So, you the clever reader might be thinking, &ldquo;Are they not just like 分かる in the previous example, where they&rsquo;re just intransitive verbs?&rdquo; Nope, they&rsquo;re <em><strong>adjectives</strong></em>.</p>

<p>I absolutely could not wrap my head around this concept when I first learned it. When we use adjectives, we are generally either saying an indisputable fact, or we preface our opinions with the fact that they are, well, opinion. (or that subjective, and not objective).</p>
<p>Not only that, while those are the closest direct translations to those individual words, they aren&rsquo;t the most commonly used phrases when trying to get those ideas across. Generally, the basic adjective いい (ii, or just pronouncing the letter &rsquo;e&rsquo;), which translates to good, is used more often to say you like something (in fact, 好き can be a lot stronger). And the -たい (tai) verb conjugation is most often used to say you want to do said verb, which lines up a lot closer to our version of want (think how often you use want to describe the want to <em>do</em> something). But, if I stopped at looking up the words, then applied my english mental model, I would, well, sound like a foreigner who hasn&rsquo;t the basic understanding of the language.</p>

<h1 id="get-to-the-point-old-man">Get to the point, old man</h1>
<p>So, what does all this have to programming languages? I think the word <em>language</em> in programming <em>language</em> is underrated. Just like we use our human language to communicate our human idea to other humans, we use our programming languages to communicate our human idea to machines. And just how our human languages affect our mental model of the world, the programming languages we use, and <em>think in</em>, affect our mental model and how we solve problems.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="programming-languages-affect-the-way-we-think-about-model-and-solve-problems">Programming Languages affect the way we think about, model, and solve problems.</h2>
<p>Whether we realize it or not, the programming languages we learn, use, and <em>like to think in</em> affect the way we think about, model, and solve problems.</p>
<p>I have been mainly using swift on my projects, while using SQL and VB (blegh) in my day job. I have often found myself rewriting some of the most egregious VB we have in swift to understand it better, partly because I have become more accustomed to <em>thinking</em> in swift. I&rsquo;ll often make 2 passes, one where I am just simplifying (de-nesting, extracting, making some extra constants, etc.), and then another where I really <em>translate</em> my model of the problem into swift, using some of its better supported language features like its powerful closures.</p>
<p>And it really does remind me of translating things between English and Japanese. This is how we would say it in VB, while this is how it would more likely be said in Swift.</p>
<p>This also applies to the code we read. One of the best ways to learn how to write in a language is to read that language. But, the concept of garbage in, garbage out still applies.</p>
<p>An example that stands out is when a coworker asked me to help him with a SQL query he was working on. We both had very little prior SQL experience, both under a year, and I was just starting to learn to use and think with CTEs. I liked to show coworkers how problems could often be solved in a simpler way using them. He was trying to get a two account types of the same profile in the same table. So the table looked sort of like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>profile_id</th>
<th>account_type</th>
<th>account_number</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>12345</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>23456</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>34567</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>45678</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>56789</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>67890</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>And he wanted this result:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>profile_id</th>
<th>account_a_number</th>
<th>account_b_number</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>12345</td>
<td>23456</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>34567</td>
<td>45678</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>56789</td>
<td>67890</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Using CTEs wasn&rsquo;t necessary here, but I wanted to demonstrate them to him. So I wrote this monstrosity:</p>

<ul>
<li>programming languages affect our mental models, and how we approach problems

<li>after C, pointers and locks</li>
<li>after swift, async await and closures</li>
<li>after fast sql, a poor solution lol</li>

<li>You carry these mental models into other languages and situations, even when the language isn&rsquo;t designed for that, and/or that model isnt the best solution for the problem

<li>The poor fast sql solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>learning not just new languages, but new paradigms is essential. being able to weigh the pros and cons of different model is what will make you an expert. when we get too comfortable in a mental model, other perfectly reasonable, and often better mental models will become foreign to us.

<p>I want to make the argument that one of the best ways to write clean, understandable software is to write it with the goal of keeping as close to our native tongue language as possible. As close to how humans think.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, we already have high level languages that bring that language of computers closer to our own languages and way of thinking. However, we all to often make the mistake of stopping there.</p>
<p>These high level languages are still fundamentally computer languages. We are creating and manipulation objects, or sending data through pipelines. However, when initially thinking about the problems at a high level, we</p>
