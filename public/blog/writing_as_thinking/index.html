<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but most of my ideas are <em>not at all</em> complete when their still in my mind. I found this out the hard way many times when trying to code my ideas, and then found it much, much easier when poking those holes while it was still on my notebook.</p>
<p>Often, those holes weren&rsquo;t poked until a few days later.</p>
<p>Why have formal docs picture, first 2 paragraphs, mmm page 111</p>
